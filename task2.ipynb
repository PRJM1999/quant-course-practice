    "The desk now has the price data they need. The final ingredient before they can begin trading with the client is the pricing model. Alex tells you the client wants to start trading as soon as possible. They believe the winter will be colder than expected, so they want to buy gas now to store and sell in winter in order to take advantage of the resulting increase in gas prices. They ask you to write a script that they can use to price the contract. Once the desk are happy, you will work with engineering, risk, and model validation to incorporate this model into production code."

    "## Provided Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Change of Structure:**\n",
    "- Transitioned to an object-oriented style of programming to ensure modularity, separation of concerns, and clearer code structure.\n",
    "- Distinctly separated the functionalities: forecasting from data and pricing the contract.\n",
    "- A test case has been implemented to validate the entire flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Forecast Code:**\n",
    "- Used the ARIMA model for forecasting the gas prices.\n",
    "- Split the data into training and testing sets based on a predefined cut-off. The training set is used to train the ARIMA model, and the test set is used for validation.\n",
    "- Utilised the pmdarima package to automatically find the best ARIMA parameters for the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Pricing Engine Code:**\n",
    "- Created a Contract class to capture the details of the gas contract, including injection and withdrawal dates, rates, storage costs, and maximum storage volume.\n",
    "- Developed a PricingEngine that utilises the forecast model to price the contract.\n",
    "- For better accuracy, linear interpolation is performed on the data to ensure that prices are available for every day.\n",
    "- Costs are computed based on the injection and withdrawal dates provided in the contract. The buying cost (injection) is subtracted, and the selling revenue (withdrawal) is added.\n",
    "- Additionally, storage costs are calculated based on the amount of gas stored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Test Case Code:**\n",
    "- Gas was procured during the first two weeks of July and intended to be sold in the first two weeks of February.\n",
    "- Leveraged the DataImporter to fetch data from the CSV file.\n",
    "- Initialised the ARIMA model and performed the analysis.\n",
    "- Defined the contract details, including specified injection and withdrawal dates and rates.\n",
    "- Employed the PricingEngine to calculate the contract's price, showcasing the end-to-end functionality of the solution.\n",
